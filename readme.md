## **Python Project #2**
### 'The Runners' Home League Program' ###
***
*working with  database manipulation (read/write/append)*
***

### Description ###
    This second project is the creation of a program capable of displaying and compilate the statistics of a long-distance running home league. Working with 3 separate databases (one for each team), the data is then used for calculating which team was the fastest, the fastest runner overall and other relevant final result info. An option to save this information into a new statistics database is offered to the user, along with the possibility of adding a fault to each or one specific team. 

    A LOOPING MENU WAS LATER ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL CODE

### Steps of the Project ###
    
    ** Step 1 **
    Create a function that open and read the data within the 3 .txt files, assigning the data to 3 separate lists by using list and string methods. 

    ** Step 2 **
    Offer a menu to the user with the following options:
        1. Display statistics
        2. Save statistics
        3. Display the most    consistent team
        4. Add faults 

    ** Step 3 **
    Create a function to display the statistics in this following way: 
        1. Team with the fastest runner and his/her time
        2. Average times for each team in ascending order. The name of the team and their time

    ** Step 4 **
    Create a function that can save the statistics into a new .txt file named 'stats'.

    ** Step 5 **
    Create a function to calculate the standard deviation of each team and display it to the console.

    ** Step 6 **
    Create a function with the task of offering a submenu to the user with the option of adding a fault to every or one specific team at the end of the stats file.
